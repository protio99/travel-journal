#### Hello again

This mini project was about a travel journal, unfortunately I never been in those places before, but I'll make sure to go some day.

#### About project


Again I have been putting in practice all the things that I had been learning in this part of the course, this time components, map function, data use etc.

Day by day I feel more confident and I think these projects were very helpful.

Below you can find a snapshot of the project
